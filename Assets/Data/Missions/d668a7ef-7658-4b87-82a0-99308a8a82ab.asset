  Title: Rainbow shield
  Description: '%COMPANY% hosts a %WEBSERVICE% that has been jammed by frequent DDOS
    attacks. You need to identify the origin of the threat and implement a robust
    counter mechanism.'
  Deadline: 9
  MissionSucceeded: The attack has been routed across the planet but you could track
    them to a command and control server in %COUNTRY%.
  MissionFailed: Seems like there is no distinct attack pattern you can focus on.
    The attackers pay much effort in hiding their identity.
