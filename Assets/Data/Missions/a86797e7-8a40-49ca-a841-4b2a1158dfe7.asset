  Title: Homefront
  Description: The guy next door, %CONTACT_M%, has a barking dog that really upsets
    you. Hack his %PW_APPLICATION% as payback.
  Deadline: 4
  MissionSucceeded: His the password of his %PW_APPLICATION% actually was 'abc123'.
    Shame if someone changed it.
  MissionFailed: You tried a brute force attack using a dictionary of the most common
    passwords but everything failed. His %PW_APPLICATION% is secure for now.
